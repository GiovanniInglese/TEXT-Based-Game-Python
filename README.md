This Python Project is a Text based game that I created in one of my first few programming classes and it is based on a text based game map that I created for a spaceship game.  The main enemy is an alien that is in one of the 8 rooms that were specified in the map.  The object of the game is to move through all of the rooms and collect all of the items from each room needed to defeat the alien that is in te final room.  The user will not know how the map looks or how the map operates sothey will have to move through and try to win the game by collecting al the items and finding the final alien boss.  The user will be given a screen that displays the room they are in and give them options to move either North, East, South, or West and they will be displayed another option to get an item.  

This program utilizes a dictionary to places items in each of the rooms as well as coorelate direction with rooms as well to simulate the player koving through each of the rooms.  This program is a simple text based game program and utilizes many basic functionalities of python such as branch statements, loops, and utilizing dictionaries.  The game also utilizes error statements which allows to check for incorrect inputs and commands.  This is so the game will nto exit in an unexpected error and it will function properly on the users side to give the user a better experience.
